{"document": "Lib Dem Lord Oates accused Labour of being prepared to \" concede everything \" , and the opposition 's leader in the Lords , Baroness Smith , responded that his party was giving people \" false hope\" . The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal . But that co - operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons . A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was \" fairly obvious grandstanding \" by the Lib Dems , and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets . \"It 's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain , when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government , \" the source said . For their part , the Lib Dems ' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of \" waving through the government 's plans \" and \" lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit\" . It 's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing . Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again , saying : \" The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on . \"But the Labour source predicted \" residual tensions \" , adding : \" I ca n't imagine there 'll be much demand here to organise a ' progressive consensus summer drinks ' gathering . \"Our respective leaderships will of course continue to keep things business - like . \"", "summary": ["the lib dems have rejected calls by the liberal democrats to set up a brexit deal with the eu ."], "factors": [[{"text": "the lib dems", "start": 0, "end": 12}, {"text": "calls", "start": 27, "end": 32}, {"text": "democrats", "start": 48, "end": 57}, {"text": "a brexit deal", "start": 68, "end": 81}, {"text": "eu", "start": 91, "end": 93}]], "corrected": ["MPs have rejected attempts by the liberal Democrats to set up a \" progressive consensus \" with the Labour Party ."]}
